## WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BROWSER TEST
## -------------------------------------------------------
## Journey 12 drives a real drag in a real browser and asserts the two things
## that make the control a scrubber: the handle tracks the pointer, and the
## session ends where the pointer was released. It is the right gate for the
## gesture and it cannot be the gate for THIS.
##
## The defect this file is written against is a drag that finishes on a
## position the visitor merely dragged THROUGH — a target decided when an
## earlier seek settled, issued after a newer one had already gone out. It
## shipped in the first draft of the drag: released at step 1052, the wire
## carried 1052 and then 707, and the session finished at 707.
##
## Reproducing it in a browser needs a pointer move to arrive after the
## in-flight slot is released and before the deferred send — a window one
## microtask drain wide. A mutation arm aimed at it SURVIVED a full journey
## run, because across roughly two dozen chances no pointer move happened to
## land there; a later attempt to force the window with injected events
## reproduced the stale request but not the stale RESTING PLACE, because the
## engine's own latency varies by a factor of twenty between the demo
## recording and a real chain capture. An arm that reproduces its own defect
## only sometimes is a coin, not evidence.
##
## `scrub_queue` exists so the rule can be stated as data. Every case below is
## an explicit sequence of calls with no clock in it, so the ordering that took
## two days to catch in a browser is six lines here and cannot be flaky.
##
## COUNTED, AND THE COUNT ASSERTED. Each suite ends by checking how many cases
## it ran, because a `for` that skipped or a `check` that was never reached
## shortens a run without failing it.

# run in total. The numbers are cumulative across suites, in file order.
